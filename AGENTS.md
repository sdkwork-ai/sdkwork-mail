# SDKWork Mail Agent Guide

This repository is the SDKWork Mail authority workspace — a standalone email application aligned with industry-grade clients (Gmail, Foxmail, Outlook).

## Canonical Standards

- Workspace rules: `../sdkwork-specs/SDKWORK_WORKSPACE_SPEC.md`
- Agent execution: `../sdkwork-specs/SOUL.md`
- Standards entrypoint: `../sdkwork-specs/README.md`

## Architecture

- **Domain:** `communication` (canonical SDKWork domain for inboxes, messages, threads)
- **Capability:** `mail`
- **Database prefix:** `mail_`
- **HTTP surfaces:** `/app/v3/api/mail/*`, `/backend/v3/api/mail/*`
- **No RPC / discovery:** This workspace has no gRPC services; `sdkwork-discovery` is deferred until RPC is introduced.

## Framework Integration (Required)

| Framework | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| `sdkwork-web-framework` | All HTTP route crates (`sdkwork-routes-mail-*-api`) via `web_bootstrap.rs`, `WebRequestContext`, IAM adapter |
| `sdkwork-database` | Application-root `database/` module, lifecycle CLI (`db:*` scripts), repository bootstrap |
| `sdkwork-utils` | Rust: `sdkwork-utils-rust` in service/plugins/route-common; TypeScript: `@sdkwork/utils` via PC/H5/mini-program cores |
| `sdkwork-appbase` | IAM login/session, generated appbase SDKs for PC/H5 clients |
| `sdkwork-drive` | Drive-backed attachments via `sdkwork-drive-app-sdk` (`driveNodeId`) and `MailDriveAttachmentPort` server validation |
| `sdkwork-discovery` | intentionally **not** integrated (no RPC services yet) |

## Required Reading By Task

- API work: `../sdkwork-specs/API_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/WEB_FRAMEWORK_SPEC.md`
- SDK work: `../sdkwork-specs/SDK_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/SDK_WORKSPACE_GENERATION_SPEC.md`
- Database work: `../sdkwork-specs/DATABASE_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/DATABASE_FRAMEWORK_SPEC.md`
- Rust backend: `../sdkwork-specs/RUST_CODE_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/WEB_BACKEND_SPEC.md`
- PC/H5 UI: `../sdkwork-specs/APP_PC_ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/APP_H5_ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md`
- IAM/security: `../sdkwork-specs/IAM_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/SECURITY_SPEC.md`
- Deployment/packaging: `../sdkwork-specs/DEPLOYMENT_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SPEC.md`

## Local Boundaries

- Mail-owned tables use the `mail_` prefix.
- API authorities live under `apis/app-api/communication/` and `apis/backend-api/communication/`.
- SDK families live under `sdks/` and must remain owner-only.
- Rust service, repository, route, and host crates live under `crates/`.
- Runnable client surfaces live under `apps/` (`sdkwork-mail-pc`, `sdkwork-mail-h5`, etc.).
- Root-level `packages/` is not allowed; app packages belong under `apps/<app-root>/packages/`.

## IM Boundary

- `sdkwork-im` may embed or depend on Mail SDKs for integrated messaging + mail UX.
- This repository must **not** depend on `sdkwork-im` or duplicate IM signaling APIs.

## Verification

```powershell
pnpm install
pnpm run verify
```

`pnpm run verify` is the canonical gate for sdkwork-specs alignment in this repository.

## Int64 Wire Contract (API_SPEC §13.6)

- OpenAPI `int64` fields and parameters `MUST` be `type: string`, `format: int64`,
  a decimal `pattern` such as `^-?[0-9]+$`, and `x-sdkwork-int64-string: true`.
  `type: integer, format: int64` is a contract violation: generated TypeScript
  SDKs then emit `number`, and browsers silently round ids past
  `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` (2^53), replaying wrong ids into lookups.
- Rust response DTOs `MUST` serialize `i64` wire fields with
  `#[serde(with = "sdkwork_utils_rust::serde_int64")]` (or `::option`); request
  boundaries parse inbound strings with the same helper.
- Generated TypeScript SDKs keep `int64` as `string`; frontend code `MUST NOT`
  convert ids/snowflake ids/sequence ids to `number` for storage, comparison,
  or submission.

## Rust Naming And Dependency Declaration

Authority: `../sdkwork-specs/NAMING_SPEC.md` section 3.1 and section 3.2.

Two identifier planes exist in every Rust crate and they MUST NOT be mixed: the package plane
(Cargo, filesystem, lock file) uses kebab-case, and the crate plane (lib target, modules, source
imports) uses snake_case.

- `[package].name`, the crate directory, `[features]` keys, and `[[bin]].name` use kebab-case.
- `[lib].name`, module files, module directories, and Rust imports use snake_case.
- A crate whose `[package].name` contains a hyphen SHOULD declare `[lib].name` explicitly
  (default: package name with every `-` replaced by `_`). A shorter lib name is allowed only
  when declared explicitly and used consistently by every consumer.
- Cargo dependency keys, `[workspace.dependencies]` keys, and `Cargo.lock` entries use the
  dependency package name. Use `package = "..."` when an alias is required.
- Every external crate referenced by `src/` MUST be declared in that crate's `[dependencies]`.
  Test-only crates belong in `[dev-dependencies]`; `build.rs` crates belong in
  `[build-dependencies]`.
- Never delete a dependency line, and never demote one from `[dependencies]` to
  `[dev-dependencies]`, while `src/` still imports it. Verify manifest cleanups with the
  command below before committing them.
- Regenerate and commit `Cargo.lock` in the same change as any dependency table edit.

```bash
node ../sdkwork-specs/tools/check-rust-crate-naming-standard.mjs --root .

<!-- SDKWORK-RUST-CODE-STANDARD: v1 -->
## Rust Code Standard

Authority: `../sdkwork-specs/RUST_CODE_SPEC.md` (v2, industry-best baseline); package/crate
naming and dependency declaration are normative in `../sdkwork-specs/NAMING_SPEC.md` section 3.1
and 3.2.

- Crates are responsibility-shaped: service, repository-sqlx, routes, service-host, native-host,
  worker, assembly, gateway. No generic `core`/`common`/`backend`/`runtime` suffixes.
- Errors are typed enums (`thiserror`) implementing `std::error::Error` with a `source` chain.
  `anyhow` only at binary/CLI/test boundaries, never in lib `[dependencies]`.
- No `unsafe` without a `// SAFETY:` comment; crates default to `unsafe_code = "forbid"`.
  No `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic!`/`todo!`/`dbg!` in library code reachable from public API.
- No lock guard held across `.await`; every external await has a timeout; spawned tasks are
  awaited/detached with a documented owner; retries are bounded, jittered, and idempotent.
- Public API is minimal, documented, `#[must_use]` where applicable, and semver-clean. Leaking
  framework types (`sqlx::Row`, axum extractors) through public signatures is forbidden.
- Workspace root declares `[workspace.package]` (edition, rust-version) and `[workspace.lints]`
  (RUST_CODE_SPEC.md section 13 baseline); every member inherits both with
  `edition.workspace = true` and `[lints] workspace = true`.

<!-- SDKWORK-TYPESCRIPT-CODE-STANDARD: v1 -->
## TypeScript Code Standard

Authority: `../sdkwork-specs/TYPESCRIPT_CODE_SPEC.md` (v2, industry-best baseline).

- `tsconfig` runs `strict: true` and the strict family; public APIs are typed and `any`-free.
  `import type` is required for type-only imports (`verbatimModuleSyntax`).
- Errors are typed at package/service boundaries; no empty catches, no swallowed promise
  rejections, no bare `throw new Error('...')` for business failures.
- Async: every promise is settled; external awaits have timeouts; `AbortSignal` accepted for
  cancellable work; bounded concurrency; no unbounded `Promise.all`.
- Public API is minimal, JSDoc-documented, `@deprecated` where applicable, and semver-clean.
- Discriminated unions model closed variant sets; no `as`/`@ts-ignore` bypasses without a guard.
- Node/build runners verify build-critical sources and self-heal from git (CODE_STYLE_SPEC §7);
  `pnpm clean` never deletes git-tracked build-critical files.

## Dart Code Standard

Authority: `../sdkwork-specs/DART_CODE_SPEC.md` (v1); Flutter root/UI rules follow
`../sdkwork-specs/FLUTTER_APP_MOBILE_ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md` and `../sdkwork-specs/APP_FLUTTER_UI_SPEC.md`.

- Sound null safety; `lints`/`flutter_lints` baseline; `dart analyze` and `dart format` clean.
- `lib/<package>.dart` barrel exports only public API; no `src/` imports across packages.
- Errors are typed exceptions or results; no bare `Exception('...')`, swallowed catches, or
  unhandled futures (`unawaited` only with a documented reason).
- `build()` is pure (no IO/network/timers); `const` constructors where possible; stable list
  keys; controllers/subscriptions disposed.
- Null safety discipline: no `!` assertions or `as` casts in public API paths; sealed classes
  for closed variant sets.
- External awaits have timeouts; blocking work moves to `compute`/isolates; no UI-thread blocking.

Verification:

```bash
dart analyze && dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed
flutter test   # or: dart test for pure Dart packages

## Frontend Code Standard

Authority: `../sdkwork-specs/FRONTEND_CODE_SPEC.md` (v2); language rules follow
`../sdkwork-specs/TYPESCRIPT_CODE_SPEC.md` (React/TS) or `../sdkwork-specs/DART_CODE_SPEC.md` (Flutter).

- UI -> service -> injected SDK flow is preserved; components never construct SDK clients or
  assemble raw HTTP/auth headers.
- React: hooks rules clean (`react-hooks`), `useEffect` with full deps and cleanup, stable
  list keys, error boundaries at route/page level, derived state during render (not in effects).
- State: server state behind services/query layer; client state local or minimal typed store;
  no duplication of server state in client stores.
- Accessibility: accessible names, keyboard behavior, visible focus, color is never the only
  signal; error states announced.
- i18n for all user-facing copy in reusable/user-facing packages (I18N_SPEC §6.1).
- PC/H5 `outDir` uses `dist/{standalone,cloud}/{dev,test,staging,prod}`.

## pnpm Workspace Dependency And Package Import

Authority: `../sdkwork-specs/PNPM_WORKSPACE_DEPENDENCY_SPEC.md` (companion to
`../sdkwork-specs/DEPENDENCY_MANAGEMENT_SPEC.md`).

Sibling SDKWork repositories are consumed through a dual-track model that MUST stay consistent:

- **Local development** (`pnpm dev`, `pnpm build`): pnpm workspace protocol. Each sibling
  package is declared ONCE in this repository root `pnpm-workspace.yaml` `packages:` as a
  `../sdkwork-*` relative path, and consumed with `workspace:*` in `package.json`. Never use
  `file:`/`link:`/git-URL specifiers for SDKWork sibling packages in any environment.
- **CI / release packaging**: git-repository dependency checkout. Every sibling referenced by the
  local workspace MUST have a matching `dependencies[]` entry in `sdkwork.workflow.json` so CI
  clones the sibling into the same `../sdkwork-*` relative layout (`GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SPEC.md`).
  `package.json` is never rewritten for CI.

Import rules for sibling SDKWork packages:

- Import by package name only: `import { X } from "@sdkwork/package-name"`. The specifier MUST
  equal the target package's `package.json` `name` exactly - no shortening, renaming, or alias.
- Forbidden: relative imports that cross a package boundary into another SDKWork repository or
  another workspace package's `src/` (for example `import ... from "../../sdkwork-appbase/.../src/..."`).
- Consume only the public `exports` surface of a package; never deep-import sibling `src/` internals.
- Every non-relative import in a workspace member MUST resolve to that member's own
  `dependencies`/`devDependencies`/`peerDependencies` (import closure).
- Vite aliases MUST NOT rename or redirect `@sdkwork/*` packages, MUST NOT be added to make a
  resolution error pass, and are allowed only for documented bootstrap/SDK-generation entrypoints.
- Fix a resolution failure by correcting the workspace declaration or the package `exports`,
  not by adding an alias.

## Generated SDK Output Is Generator-Owned

Authority: `../sdkwork-specs/SDK_SPEC.md` and `../sdkwork-specs/SDK_WORKSPACE_GENERATION_SPEC.md`.

Everything generated under `sdks/` — `generated/server-openapi/` trees, generated language
workspaces, `dist/` build output, generated `sdkwork-sdk.json`, generated
`.sdkwork/sdkwork-generator-*` reports, and standardizer-synced OpenAPI snapshots — is produced by
the canonical SDK generator `../sdkwork-sdk-generator/bin/sdkgen.js` (`@sdkwork/sdk-generator`).

- Do not hand-edit generated SDK files, including type definitions, dist bundles, and generated
  package metadata. Manual edits are overwritten by the next generation run and break
  reproducibility and contract audits.
- When generated or compiled SDK output does not meet a contract or standard, fix the upstream
  source — authored API contract, route manifest, OpenAPI authority, derived `*.sdkgen.*` input,
  generator profile, or `custom/` runtime build scripts — then regenerate through the standard
  generation command. Do not patch generated output in place.
- Remove stale generated files by re-running the family generation command, which owns cleanup of
  disappeared routes and models; do not hand-prune generated trees.
- The only approved handwritten surfaces are `custom/` roots inside generated workspaces and
  authored `composed/` facades outside `generated/server-openapi`.
